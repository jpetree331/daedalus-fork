"""The raise site every MCP tool refusal must witness, read from the source.

Nothing in TOOL_REFUSALS says which guard a case exists for, so deleting one
used to assert nothing. This reads every raise the modules the composition
can import spell and makes each site an obligation of the tools that reach
it, keyed (dotted module, function, condition).

Its limits, so nobody reads more into it than it does. It witnesses raise
sites that exist in the source; a guard deleted together with its declaration
is invisible to it, and for a guard nothing else pins, that deletion is
invisible everywhere. Reach is lexical — closure cells, defaults,
`__wrapped__`, module globals — so a site reached any other way is refused by
the pin run, not missed. The `or` refusal reads the `if` test a raise sits
DIRECTLY under: a raise reached through `try`, `while` or `else` bodies, or
a test spelled `not (a and b)`, is one site like any other. A refusal
written as `return {'error': ...}` — the
convention at daedalus_mcp/tools_css.py `unblock_requests` — never raises and
is off this floor.
